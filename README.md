# Cryptography_Tools_Python
A lot of programs containing most common python library functions for Cryptography
Have a function with the name "des_input_av_test" that accepts 16 bytes long byte-sequence (plaintext) as its first argument, a 8 bytes long byte-sequence (key) as its second argument, and a list (specifying the position of the bit to be flipped) as its third argument and returns a list of the same length as the third argument. e.g., function call: des_input_av_test(b'thisoneis16bytes',b'deskey!!',[3, 25, 36]) should return a list [27, 35, 28]
Have a function with the name "des_key_av_test" that accepts 16 bytes long byte-sequence (plaintext) as its first argument, a 8 bytes long byte-sequence (key) as its second argument, and a list (specifying the position of the bit to be flipped) as its third argument and returns a list of the same length as the third argument. e.g., function call: des_key_av_test(b'thisoneis16bytes',b'deskey!!',[3, 25, 36]) should return a list [56, 68, 64]
Have a function with the name "aes_input_av_test" that accepts 16 bytes long byte-sequence (plaintext) as its first argument, a 16 bytes long byte-sequence (key) as its second argument, and a list (specifying the position of the bit to be flipped) as its third argument and returns a list of the same length as the third argument. e.g., function call: aes_input_av_test(b'thisoneis16bytes',b'veryverylongkey!',[5, 29, 38]) should return a list [65, 67, 68]
Have a function with the name "aes_key_av_test" that accepts 16 bytes long byte-sequence (plaintext) as its first argument, a 16 bytes long byte-sequence (key) as its second argument, and a list (specifying the position of the bit to be flipped) as its third argument and returns a list of the same length as the third argument. e.g., function call: aes_key_av_test(b'thisoneis16bytes',b'veryverylongkey!',[5, 29, 38]) should return a list [61, 65, 65]
